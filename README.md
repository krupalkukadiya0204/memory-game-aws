Architecture Overview
This project leverages the power of Amazon Web Services (AWS) to provide a scalable and efficient backend infrastructure.

### AWS Services Used
AWS CodePipeline: Automates the deployment process, ensuring that updates to the game are smoothly integrated and released. The pipeline includes build, test, and deployment stages, providing continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD).

Amazon S3: Hosts the static assets of the game, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files. S3 provides high availability and durability, ensuring that game assets are always accessible to users.

### Deployment
The game is automatically deployed to AWS through the CI/CD pipeline defined in AWS CodePipeline. The following steps outline the deployment process:

Source Stage: The code repository is integrated with AWS CodePipeline, and any changes made to the codebase trigger the pipeline.

Build Stage: The build stage compiles and packages the application code, preparing it for deployment.

Deploy Stage: The final build artifacts are uploaded to Amazon S3, making them available for users to access and play the game.
